# Emergency Lights Simulator

In some photography usage scenarios, creators may require the use of some kinds of emergency light sources such as police light bar, but normally rod lights do not have the ability of flashing at a high frequency. Therefore, the development of this simple Web app can use our screens to play a role as a flash light source for photography, and this Web app supports display synchronization between multiple displays on the same PC terminal.
Finally, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
